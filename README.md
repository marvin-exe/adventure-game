Short adventure game with a few random options

## Introduction
This is a short adventure game that I did for a programming course.
It is heavily inspired by the game Nier Automata which is one of my favorite games.

## Aditional info
If you want to try it by yourself feel free to download it and run it.
Iwould like to keep adding more areas and more plot so any advice is welcome
